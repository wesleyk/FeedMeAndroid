FeedMe
======

FeedMe was our Greylock Hackfest 2012 entry,
built on 7/21/12-7/22/12 at Dropbox.

The Story
---------
My team set out to build the seamless restaurant experience.

On the business side is a web-app that restaurants can use to:
* keep track of where customers are seated
* receive real-time orders from customers
* get notified if a customer would like to see a waiter
* accept payments from a customer

On the consumer side is an Android application that customers can use to:
* check into restaurants (via NFC tags available at each table
of the restaurant)
* view the menu and ratings for each item
* order what food they would like
* pay for their meal
* leave reviews for the meal they just ate

This repository represents the Android side of the application.
The web app side was built by two other members of my team and can
be found at: https://github.com/daniechiu/FeedMeRails.

Techonologies Used
------------------
The hackathon gave me a chance to play with some cool technologies.
The experience taught me so many things, among them:
* Developing Android mobile applications
* Using Facebook's Android SDK for user authentication
* Working with Stripe's payment API
* Reading from and writing to NFC tags 
* Developing a custom REST API built on RoR
